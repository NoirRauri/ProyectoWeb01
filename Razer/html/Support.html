                  <h6>What is a mobile phone baseband?</h6>
                  <p>
                    Baseband is the inherent frequency band (frequency
                    bandwidth) of the original electrical signal without
                    modulation and transformation sent by the Baseband signal
                    source (also called the transmitter). The "baseband" of a
                    mobile phone has two meanings: one refers to the hardware,
                    the communication module (modem) of the mobile phone and
                    other equipment; the other refers to the software, which
                    supports the control software (firmware) required by the
                    communication module of the mobile phone and other equipment
                    to complete signal processing. The query path of the
                    baseband version information in the MIUI system:
                    <code
                      >Settings---About Device---All specs---Baseband
                      Version.</code
                    >The baseband version information is updated with the update
                    of the MIUI version, and there may be cases where the MIUI
                    system version is updated but the baseband version is not.
                  </p>
                  <h6>
                    How to deal with the loss of baseband information on the
                    mobile phone?
                  </h6>
                  <p>
                    After the baseband information is lost, the SIM card will
                    not be recognized. You can go to
                    <code
                      >Settings---About Device---All specs---Baseband
                      Version</code
                    >
                    to check the baseband version. If the baseband version is
                    displayed as "unknown" or "baseband information is lost",
                    which may means that the baseband firmware is abnormal, you
                    can try to update MIUI to the latest version to fix it; if
                    it is still not resolved, apply for after-sales service.
                  </p>
                  <h6>Why does the baseband version change?</h6>
                  <p>
                    Baseband (software) refers to the control software
                    (firmware) required to support the communication module of
                    mobile phones and other devices to complete signal
                    processing. This part of the firmware is stored in the
                    mobile phone system software package (ROM package) and needs
                    to be updated with the MIUI version to upgrade, but The
                    baseband version exists independently, and there may be
                    cases where the system version is upgraded but the baseband
                    version is not upgraded.
                  </p>
                  <h6>Notes:</h6>
                  <p>
                    The baseband chip design at the hardware level relies on the
                    CPU platform. Some CPU platforms will integrate the baseband
                    chip, and some baseband processors will exist independently.
                    The baseband control software (firmware) at the software
                    level is stored in the mobile phone system software package
                    (ROM package), and the MIUI version needs to be updated to
                    upgrade, but the baseband version exists independently, and
                    there are cases where the system version is upgraded but the
                    baseband version is not upgraded.

                  <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It
                  is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the
                  appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
                  classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing
                  and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this
                  with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also
                  worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
                  <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit
                  overflow.

                      I spent hours fixing the problem i was having with synapse

                      sooooo good it literally made my day. Foxed my issue in no
                      time. 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ best support out there.
